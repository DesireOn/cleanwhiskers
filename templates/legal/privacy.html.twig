      <li><strong>Right to opt out of sale/share:</strong> If we ever sell/share data, you can opt out via the
        <a href="{{ path('app_privacy_do_not_sell') }}">Do Not Sell or Share My Info</a> link or by emailing
        <a href="mailto:support@cleanwhiskers.com">support@cleanwhiskers.com</a>.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2 id="sensitive-data">Sensitive Data Handling</h2>
    <p>
      We do not collect sensitive personal information. If we ever collect information such as pets’ medical details, owner payment information, or precise geolocation, we will update this policy and provide appropriate rights and limitations.
    </p>

    <h2 id="security">Data Security</h2>

    </p>

    <h2 id="choices">How to Exercise Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Contact us at <a href="mailto:support@cleanwhiskers.com">support@cleanwhiskers.com</a> or use the
      <a href="{{ path('app_privacy_do_not_sell') }}">Do Not Sell or Share My Info</a> link. For details on how we verify and process requests, see
      <a href="#verification">Request Verification</a> below.
    </p>

    <h2 id="verification">Request Verification</h2>
    <p>
      To protect your privacy, we verify your identity before fulfilling requests to know, access, delete, or correct personal information.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Primary methods:</strong> We confirm via a link or one‑time code sent to the email address we have on file for your inquiry; if you provided a phone number, we may send a one‑time SMS code to that number.</li>
      <li><strong>Matching data points:</strong> We match the information you provide (for example, email, phone, and city/service details) to information already on file. For access/deletion, we generally require at least two matching data points. For requests that involve disclosing specific pieces of information, we may require an additional data point and/or a signed declaration.</li>
      <li><strong>Authorized agents:</strong> If you use an authorized agent, we require a signed authorization (or power of attorney) and we will verify your identity directly.</li>
      <li><strong>If we can’t verify:</strong> We will explain why and may request additional information reasonably necessary to verify. We only use information provided for verification to process your request.</li>
      <li><strong>Timing:</strong> We acknowledge and respond within 45 days. If reasonably necessary, we may take up to an additional 45 days and will notify you of the extension.</li>
      <li><strong>No account required:</strong> You do not need to create an account to submit a request. We do not charge a fee for processing rights requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="children">Children’s Privacy (COPPA/CPRA Minors)</h2>
    <p>
      Our services and lead forms are not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No sale/share of minors’ data:</strong> We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of consumers under 16.</li>
      <li><strong>Parental rights:</strong> If you believe your child under 13 has provided personal information, contact
        <a href="mailto:support@cleanwhiskers.com">support@cleanwhiskers.com</a>. If we learn that we collected information from a child under 13, we will delete it and take reasonable steps to remove it from our records.</li>
      <li><strong>Future changes:</strong> If our practices change to include selling/sharing data, we will obtain “opt‑in” authorization (affirmative consent) from consumers aged 13–16 and verifiable parental consent for children under 13, as required by law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="effective">Effective Date and Updates</h2>
